# Portfolio

My web developer portfolio, showcasing some custom front end work along with some select projects that I've worked on.

Visit The Deployed Link: https://jmschindele.github.io/portfolio

Utilized: HTML5, CSS4, BootStrap4, Javascript, jQuery

## Getting Start
  1. Landing Page
  2. Skills Section
  3. Portfolio Section
  
  ### Landing Page
  * The page loads in with a timed out load in of the "web developer" title.
  * Hovering over the name "Schindele" switches the text to show the pronunciation instead of the spelling.
  * A navigation bar is at the top right of the screen, which shrinks and drops opacitity on the first scroll, following the user through the webpage.
  * The navbar expands back to original size and opacity on hover, with additional hover effects on the including icons.
  * Icons are included to my linkedIn page, my Githubm and a direct email link.
  
  ## Skills Section
   * This section highlights my skills, broken down into categories of 
      * HTML
      * CSS
      * JavaScript
      * Backend
      * Other
   * The resume rows opens a PDF of my resume in a new tab when clicked.
   * Hover events on the rows shift to a dark themed version of the current row, with some dynamic affects on the scaling and shadows.
   
   ## Portfolio Section
   * This section shows some selected projects and gives a link to the project.
     ** On the Desktop version, a hover over the project will cause an overlay to slide over the project, and the project to zoom in.
     ** On the mobile version, the zoom is diasbled and the hover will cause the overlay to fade in instead of sliding.
   * The blocks that show the projects have a screen shot of the project to give the user an idea of what they will see when they click the project title in the overlay.
   * The overlays show the project name and have icons for the technologies used to make the project that show at the bottom of the overlay.
      

  
  ## Continuing Improvements
  * Continue responsive development by adjusting animations and handlers to be more mobile friendly.
  * Add additional language images to be displayed on projects section.
  * Build full stack version of the application, housing all projects in a database with lazy loading.
